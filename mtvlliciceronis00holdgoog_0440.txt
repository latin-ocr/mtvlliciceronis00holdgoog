spent the first eighteen years 01 his life. He afterwards went to Athens iu
110 3²3 and thence to Colophon and Mitylene and Lampsacus, where he
taught philosophy 101 five years. 111110. 306 he went back to Athens and
purchased the famous κῆποι Ἐπικούρου 111 which he established his philo·
sophical school. Our principa] source 01 inlonnation respecting him is the
tenth book 01 Diogenes Laertius, besides the philosophical poem 01 Lucre·
tius de rerum natura, Cicero de finibus and de 11111111 deorum, who writes
in a hostile spirit about his philosophy and unjustly brands him as a man
devoted to sensual pleasures Diogenes calls him πολυγραφώτατος and
gives a list 01 the best 01 his works together with some 01 his letters and
the κύριαι δόξαι, ie· peculiar propositions, containing the substance 011110
ethical philosophy. His most important work was that περὶ φύσεως in 37
books, parts 01 which were discovered among the rolls at Herculaneum
and have been published. Epicurus prided'himsell upon being 0111οᾶ101·
τος, buthe was in reality indebted both to Democritus and the Cyrenaics.
His ethical system arose lrom the peculiar circumstances 01 his time, when,
in the absence 01 political lreedom, thinking men endeavoured to establish
an internal lreedom based upon ethical principlesz they regarded perfect
independence, seli-reliance, and contentment as the summum bonum, lol-
loving the dogma 01 the Cyrenaics that pleasure constitutes the highest
happiness and consequently must be the end 01 all human exertions. But
pleasure with him was conceived 01 not as a mere momentary and transi·

and hervich-peace 01 mind based upon φρόνησις, which he described as
the beginning 01 everything good, as the origin 01 all virtues, and even as
the summum bonum itselr. In the physical part 011110 philosophy 110
adopted the atomic theory 01 Democritus, as we know from Lucretius.
His ethical doctrines were much mistalren 11111101 ages, and made to mi·
nister to mere sensuality. At Rome, owing to the paramount influence 01
the Stoical philosophy, they never took firm root. See Dict. of Gr. and
