PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

THE present edition os the de rrfficiis has been so much
altered and enlarged that it may sairly lay claim to
be considered a new work rather than a second edition
of the volume published fifteen years ago. The latter
laboured under so many blemishes and imperfectioris
which time and, I trust, more matured scholarship have
enabled me to correct, that Ι could not rest satisfied
without subjecting it to a thorough revision, notwith-

standing the scanty leisure lelt me by arduous pro·

fessional duties: under this process the commentary
on the text has grown to double its original bulk,
a large amount os explanation and illustration having

been added to the notes which have themselves been
abridged and otherwise modified‚ in many cases en-
tirely re-written.

I trust that the volume in its new form may satissy
the wants ol more than one class of readers-I may
now venture to add of both sexes,
