the annalist (Brut. ἕ 106, de leg. 1 ἓ 6, ep. ad fam. rx 11, 1), was the
author of the law which established a permanent commission (quaestio
perpetua) for the trial of provincial Governors who had been guilty of such
illegal acts as came under the denomination repetundae. The law was
carried by him when tribunus plebis, Β. c. 149 (Brut. l. 1.). Pighius (ann.
Rom. 11 p. 447) gives the following as the supposed text of the law: uti
quibus in provinciis magistratus populi Romani 1111111111 comites eontra leges
pecunius cepissent quidve eonrmisissent, earum iniuriarum ergo Romae quiri·
tari iustitioque qreaesito sua repetere provinciales possent. The experiment
was found to work so well that from time to time new laws were passed,
by which new courts of a similar description were instituted for the investi·
gation of different offences, as the [1111111111 passed by M. Junius Brutus,
