(Panaetii nurgum, de div. 1 5 6). He was a zealous opponent of the Aca-
demias, of whose dialectic, however, he had such a sear that he would
never commit himself to a viva voce dispute with them, whence his nick·
name ὁ καλαμοβόας, Acad. pr. sr. 153, 116, 17, 5 28, 5 109. His opinion
rests here and 5 91 on the claims of moral law, to which the maxim, that
each person is a member of the community and must not do anything
which is injurious to it, is referred, whereas Diogenes holds by commercial
law. He was prior in age to the Antipater mentioned in 11 5 86.
