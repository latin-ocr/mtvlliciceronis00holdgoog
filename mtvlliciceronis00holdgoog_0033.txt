Introduction xxix

63 and xxiii 893 Diogenes of Babylon, and Antipater of Tarsus,
CH. xii 51 to cli. xiii 55 and ert. xxiii 91. But we can easily
believe, without any express assurance on his part, that he did not
follow any of these authorities in the same way as he has followed
Panaetius in his First and Second Books. Of Poseidonius indeed
Cicero says that he has touched only briefly on the subject in
quibusdam commutarim from him then Cicero cannot have r
borrowed much in this Third Book, which contains but little
systematic exposition, and is mostly taken up with examples and
illustratione.

Again, it would appear that he had never even seen the writings
of Diogenes and Antipater but had learned their views at second
hand, it we may judge from his mode of quotation, by which
he unconsciously reveals to us the fact that he had never read them
himself He begins by parading the opposing views of the two
philosophers‚ and stans an imaginary dialogue between them (CH.
xii 51—011. xiii 5 5)-probahly not his own invention but that of
some one who knew them thoroughly-and then (CH. xxiii 89-91)
puts some questions of conscience from the Sixth Book of Hekatdn,
who was a pupil of Panaetius, as Cicero tells us (5 63), and
therefore much younger than Diogenes and Antipater3 for Anti-
pater was a pupil of Diogenes, and Panaetius himself of Antipater.
Among these problems of Hekatdn is one (cu. xxiii 91) about
which there was a similar difference of opinion between Diogenes
and Antipater, as that about the preceding question. This can
only be explained by supposing that Hekatdn expatiates in his
Sixth Book on the difference os opinion between these two philoso-
phers‚ and that Cicero owes his knowledge of the views of Diogenes
and Antipaterindirectly to Hekatdn3 for it is an absurdity to suppose
that they could have come to a decision on questions started by
Hekatdn, as must be assumed from Cicero's representation. But if
Cicero in this one instance knew Diogenes and Antipater only in·
directly through Hekatdn, it may be taken for granted that this is
the case where he quotes them for the first time without naming
Hekatdn. The opinions broached in CH. v 21—CH. vi 32, with the
mention of Hercules and Phalaris, are altogether in the spirit of the
solutions ascribed to Hekatdn in CH. xxiii tot, and the manner
also of stating and solving the problems in§ 29 coincides with that
peculiar to Hekatdn. lt appears then that Cicero had no sources to
rely on in his Third Book except Poseidonius, who can scarcely be
considered such, and Hekatdn, and the latter perhaps not at all.
