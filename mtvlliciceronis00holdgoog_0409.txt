52, Sueton. vit. Aug. 13 alios, patrem ct filium, pra vita rogantes sarriri
vel micare iussaise, ut alterutri comederetur. The word merare was ap-
plied to a simple garne of the Romans which is still common enough among
their descendants and called la merra, in French la mrurre. The game is
this: oi two persons one, at a given signal, quickly opens any number ol his
fingens. At the same moment the other endeavours to match his opponent
by opening the same number. In the light, ol course, each could see, as soon
as it was done, whether the gness was right. In the dark, honesty would be
the only check to deception ε hence to play with a man in the dark implied
full confidence in him. See note by Sir J. G. Wilkinson in Rawlinson's
