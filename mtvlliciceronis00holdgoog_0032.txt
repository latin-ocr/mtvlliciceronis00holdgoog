xxviii Introduction

xvi f., CHH. xix 65 ff. and xxi, and the last meagre section CH. xxv,
containing the comparatio utilitatum, to be convineed that we are
not reading a mere translation from a Greek philosophieal work.
In ξ 86 also two points are lightly touched upon, which Antipater
of Tyre found wanting in Panaetius. On the other band, when in
CH. v 16 and in CH. x 35 Cic. speaks of his own independent treat-
ment of the subject and criticizes or appeals to that of Panaetius, it
is a proof indeed, if any were needed, that he does not stick to his
subject-matter slavishly, but it argues rather in favour esthan
against his dependence on his authorities in these passages.
Generally, however, the Second Book gives us the impression
of greater independence of judgment on the 'writer’s part, even
in,the arrangement of the subject. How far the frequent re-
petitions⁴3 of matters, already treated of in the First Book, are
chargeable to Cic. or Panaetius, must remain undetermined;
Panaetius certainly cannot be held responsible for the blunder

in ἓ 22 in considering the question how we can make ourselves
useful to others, where the same subdivision is given twice over
and subsequently abandoned in favour of another. lt seems more
than doubtful, whether Cicero has made further use of Antipater
of Tyre—whom he does not quote elsewhere-than in the mention

of the two points omitted by Panaetius ; and it is not even known
for certain whether Antipater himself wrote a treatise on duties, or,
as is more probable, indulged in occasional comments only on that
of Panaetius.

In the Third Book, the question is broached, how we are to
act in case of a conflict between the honestum and the utile,
i. e. between that which is good in itself and abstractedly, and that
which is good in reference to external objects. Panaetius himself
had intended to answer this question, but he did not fulfil his
intention (111 2, 7).

In this discussion Cicero prides himself on his greater self·
dependence CH. vii. 34: Hauc partem relictam explebimus nullitat-
miuiculis, sed, ut dicitur, Marte uestro. Neque enim quicquam est
de leae parte post Panaetium explicatum, quod quidem mitri pru-
bnretur‚ de iis quae iu manus meas uenerunt. But it does not
necessarily follow from this statement that he has not availed him·
self of any other sources. In fact be expressly mentions several
such by name :-P0seidonius, CH. ii 8 ; Hekat6n of RhodeS, CHH. xv
