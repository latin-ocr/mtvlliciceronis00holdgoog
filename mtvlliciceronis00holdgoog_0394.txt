one ot' which every action at law must be brought as in our law under the
head (farinula) ol selony, larceny‚ arson, misdemeanour, dic.

Upon the su pressiori os certain sacramental forms called leget actiones
‘actions of the iaw' by the lex Aebutia about tac. noo by reason of'the
excessive nicety oi their technicalities, the formulary system took their
place. The essential feature oi this system consisted in a formula, which
the praetor (in irae) prepared after hearing the parties to a suit, and which
was remitted to the iudex to regulate his decisiou (iu iudicio). All the
formulae generally in use were to be found in the alium Praetoris, and
they were multiplied from time to time to suit the exigencies ol particular
cases The three parts os the formula were (1) the demonstratio,
(statement oi laets, and ground of action), (a) intentio (plaiutifs s claim,
and the question lor the decision of the iudex, and which might be
modified with the words quantuor aequius ortelius sit, or ex fide barm,
binding the iuriex to take the whole circumstances into equitable considem-
tion), (3) condemnatio, which gave the iudea power to condemn or acquit
the defendant, and which was usually qualibed with a taxatio, restrictrng
the amount of damages to be awarded by the iudex to a certain maximum,
or adiud i cati o, giving the iudex or arbiter power to adjudicate. We have
the text oi a formula given by Gaius (4, 47), in a case where Aulus Agerius
sued Numerius Negidius for restoration os a silver table deposited with him
and, sailing restitution‚ ior payment ol damages :-

Octauius iudex esto; Quod Aulus Agerius apud Numerium
Negidium mensam argenteam deposuit ; qua de re agitur ;

Quidquid ob eam rem N. Negidiunt A. A geria dare facere
oportet ex fide bona eius ;

iudex N. Nigidium A. Agerio condemnato, nisi restituat;
si nou paret, absolvito.

When the parties had appeared in court, the plaintiff declared his form oi
action (ecditio actionis), and applied to the magistrate sor a formula
(actionis postulatio). The magistrate or praetor appointed a iudex ior the
trial of the case, and delivered to him a iormula determining the question
to be decided. The delivery oi the formula cum iudicium mchpitur was
the moment ol the litis contestatio, which ended the proceedings in iure.
Such formulae were those of Aquilius de dolo malo sor the guidance ol
the iudex in a claim for restitution‚ where a fraud had been practised ina
sale or some similar proceeding. The formulary system remained in
force until the reign os Diocletian, Α. n. 294. See Lord Mackenzie Studia
in Roman Lara p. 349 ft, Ramsay Rom. Antiq. p. 278 ft, Gibbou's Roman
Enrpire, ch. XLIV.
