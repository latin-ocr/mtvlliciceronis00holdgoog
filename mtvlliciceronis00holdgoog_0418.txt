acret constantia magis et integritate quom, ut nerlii videtur, consilio aut

responsum sit, ib. 11 1, 8.

h. n. vn 41, una farotilr'o Curionum in qua tres continua serie oratores
extiterunt. The first (Curio pater) was a distinguished orator (eloquen-
tissimus temporibus suis de orat. 11 5 98, Brut. 5 rra), who spoke aiust
Servius Fulvius, when accused of incest. The second is the one re erred
to iu the text aud again 11 5 59. He was tribune of the plebs nc. 90,
and, after seruing under Sulla in Greece, became praetor nc. 82 aud
consul ne. 76. At the expiration of his consulship he was made pro·
consul of Macedonia, where he carried the war against the barbariam
as far north as the Danube, and celebrated a triumph over the Dardaniaus
iu 71 lin Pis. 5 44). Au intimate friend and supportet of Cicero, he
entertained a personal eumity to Caesar, which was probably the cause
why he spoke iu favour of Clodius when accused of violating the saera
of the Bona Dea: iu ne. 57 he was made pontifex maximus. Cicero
speaks highly of him as a man, (ep. ad Quint. fr. 11 3, a, iu Vatia. 5 ²4
perpetuum bostem improborum omnium, auctorem publici consilii, libertate
contremui tuenda maxirue liberum), but he did not shine as an orator,
orator Latine uon pessime loquebatur, sed erat indoctus, meritoria nulla,
actrbne ridiculus, Brut. 5 213, 5 ars-2175 aro. His son was also a
friend of Cicero, the first seven letters of whose second book of epistulae
ad familiares are addressed to him, but unlike his father, a profligate. He
was married to Fulvia, who afterwards became Antony's wife. He was
oue of the main iustrumeuts in kindling the war between Caesar and
Pompey and on the breaking out of the war served under Caesar aud fell
iu battle against Juba and the Pompeian party.
