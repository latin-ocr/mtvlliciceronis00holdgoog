1. 1¹1. ab tto-Romam means aaut] According to Sallust l. c. Metel·
lus had given leave to Marius to return horne at his own suit, and more·
over had proroked him by his sneers. So Plutarch. Mar. 8 σὺ δὴ καταλι·
uuir ἡμᾶς, ὦγενναῖε, πλεῖν ἐπ’ οἴκου διανοῇ καὶ παραγγέλλειν ὑπατείαν ; orl
γὰρ ἀγαπήσεις, α”ν τῷ tau παιδὶ τούτῳ συνυπατεύσῃι; ἥν tetrarte rbre
τοῦ Μετέλλαν παντάπασι μειράκιον.

l. 18. ducere] i.e. producere, trahere, ‘that he was protracting.' Illum
refers of course to Metellus, although the simple pronoun oi reference eum
had been used in speaking of him before in the same sentence: the reason
is, that another subject intervenes viz. papulum Romanum, hence the
necessity for a more distinct reference in mentioning Metellus

l 19. sl-tectssent] For tense see 5 771. 29 n.

1. 2⁰. redeam] Sall. l. c. represents Marius as saying dimidia
pars exercitus si ribi permitteretur, paruis dietus Iugurtham in catenis trabi·
turum, ab imperatore cararrelta tralti, quad Ιιαννια inanis et regaae superbiae
impertit nimis gauderet.

1 22. qut-adduxerit] causal subjunctive, ‘because be brought into
odium by a false accusation)

mulus legatus esset] This is repeated for the purpose of marking more
strongly the impiety of the act laesia mandati. It was considered as a
hreach of piety for a former legatus to appear as a witness in a court of
justice against his inperator.

§⁸021 24. ne noster quidem emuttanas] ie. ne noster (⁶my rela-
tive') quidem Marius, nempe Gratide'emus, 5 67. M. Marius Grati·
dianus, son of M. Gratidius, adopted son of a brother of the famous
Marius (de leg. 111 5 36). He was praetor Β. c. 86 and for the second time
nc. 82. His edictum concerning the coinage (see below note to l. νγ)
made him very popular, so that statues were raised in all the public places
to the author of so beneficent a reform, and almost diuinehonours were

pald to these statues by burriing incense and wan sapere uetere unm.
