Sulla visited him with cruel retribution for this popularity. He was
a formidable political adversary, and in the eyes of the aristocratic party he
had committed a veritable crime in assailing a right of the State to alter
the value of the coinage. As soon therefore as the dictator entered Rome,
all the statues of Gratidianus were overthrown, and he himself proscribed
and cruelly murdered, Cic. de pet. cons. i ro, Seneca de ira 111 18, Lucan

'l'he lex Flaminia, passed ata great crisis of peril to the Republic, when
Hannibal was now at the gates of the city, suddenly reduced the silver
denarius, which became from that time the true standard of value‚ from
,if to ᾗ of a pound. It was this law which established the false principle of
regarding gold and silver coinage merely as a conventional sign of value,
subject to the will of the sovereign or the state. By means of the theory of
the mooun-sign the monied oligarchy of Rome produced grave perturbatione
in the monetary system by falsifying the coins. In each successive issue of
denarii there was a larger and larger proportion of plated pieces (ie. of
money containing only a thin coating of the true metal over copper or iron),
until Bc. 9¹ M. Livius Drusus caused the Senate to pass a decision that
in future issues there should be one plated copper denarius to seven of
silver. A few years later, in Cinna's time, the value of the coinage had
become so dubious that no one knew what he was worth (quid haberet).
In mc. 84 the tribunes of the people and the praetors deliberated on the
measures to be taken in order to remedy this deplorable state ol things.
An edict of the praetors instituted officers for the verification of the coinage,
