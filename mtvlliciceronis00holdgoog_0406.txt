the MSS. But Cicero cannot possibly bave meant to speak ot' the neme
Basilus (βασιλεύς) (which was common in the gens Minucia, as Rex and
Regulus in other iamilies) as a turpis noto temponem, the worst he could
see in it was anealum omen. Nomen ellonem is evidently a comment
introduced by some scribe, who did not understand that the exclamarint
relers lo the preceding patronum agei Piceni. lt is a disgrace that states,
who enjoyed the Roman temtus, should choose a patronus, like conquered
people (1 5 35), and, in Cicero's view, that they should choose such
men as Autony and Satrius, rather than Brutus and Cassius. Moreover
illorum cannot be right, because, as Satrius was still patronus at the time
when Cicero wrote this, he must have written temporum lorum.
