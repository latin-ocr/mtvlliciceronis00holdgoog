xxiv Introduction

Antipater 01 Tarsos, and a friend of Laelius and Scipio Africanus³⁸
the younger-whom he accompanied on his embassy to the kings
os Egypt and Asia in alliauce with Rome two years after the
conquest 01 Carthago. He died at Athens before uc. 11139.
To say nothing 01 his divergence from their original doctrine on
other points, such as Divination, ])1111111540 110, Panaetius not only
introduced into his ethics a modification of the system os the older

Stoics, to such an extent that they would scarcely have allowed
him the name of a Stoic at all, but also emancipated himself
entirely from them in his method of philosophizing. Thus ac·
cording to Cicero (Paradox. 1, 2) Stoica haeresis nullum sequitur
florem orationis neque dilatat argumentum, minutis interrogatiun-
culis, quasi punctus, quod preposuit efficit, 1.1. ‘the Stoic sect
do not aim at using flowery language or amplifying their subject,
but they prove their propositions by means 01 short syllogisms‚
like so many brief clauses’, while their method 01 expression he
describes as exiles nec satis populari adsensioni accommodata
(Brut. 1 1141. Η1 reiterates the complaints, advanced by the
opponents of orthodox 5101115111, 01 their obscuritas, dumeta etc.

On the other hand he extols the merit of Panaetius and his
superiority over his predecessors‚ whom he designates (de fin. lv
28, 79) as horridiores, asperiores, duriores et oratione et moribus i.e.
‘very rough, rugged and hard, both in speech and in manner'3-
Quam illorum tristitiam atque asperitatem fugiens Panaetius nec
acerbitatem sententiarum nec disserendi spinas¹ probavit fuitque iu
altero genere mitior, in altero illustrior semperque habuit in orc
Platonem Aristotelem Xenocratem Theophrastum Dicaearchum,
ait ipsius scripta declarant, quos quidem tibi studiose et eh'lcjgenter
tractandos magnopere censeo i.e. ‘Panaetius, avoiding this gloom
and rigour of theirs gave no sanction either to their bitter dogmas
or their thorny 1111111110, but in the one branch was more gentle

than they, 111 the other more 1011110005, and, as his own writings ,

prove, always had on his lips Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, Theo-
phrastus, Dicaearchus'. Again in de off. 11 10, 35 he says
popularibus uerbis est agendum et usitatis, cum· loquimur de
opinione populari, idque eodem modo fecit Panaetius 11. ‘one
must employ popular and familiar language when we are speaking
