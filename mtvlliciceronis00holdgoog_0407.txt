takes them literally as one oi the judicial sorrnularies in the cretio heredi·

turning him round with a gentle blow on the cheek; ...... the clenched fist
was the symbol oi a pledge or deposit ; the right band was the gift of saith
and confidence. The indenture os covenants was a broken straw 3 weights

accepted a testament was sometimes obliged to snap his
