provided with a most liberal allowance⁷‚ he fell into extravagant
habits; but afterwards he reformed his mode of life and became a
t diligent student of philosophy under Cratippus of Mitylene, who
i was at that time head of the Peripatetic Schoolss. After the death-
of Caesar, he was raised to the rank of military tribune by Brutus,
and did much good service in the course of the Macedonian
campaign⁹. The attainder pronounced upon the father was ex-

him. When his party was broken up by the rout at Philippi,
he joined Sextus Pompeius in Sicily aud taking advantage

Here he lived in retirement, until Octavianus paid the debt he

Consulship in nc. 30 after his final rupture with Antonius. It was
during his consulship that the decree was passed for destroy-
ing all the statues and monuments of Marcus Antonius ; so that, as
Plutarch remarks, the completion of the triumvir's punishmentwas
reserved by·divine justice for the house of Cicero¹⁰. On the
expiration of his term of office, he was made Proconsul of Asia.

recognition of his son’s progress in his studies and fulfilment of
his fathers hopes-there are sundry though slight positive indi-
cations in the present work11‚ which lead us to suspect that Cicero
had reason to believe, that he could not choose a fitter subject
of instruction for his son than that of ‘propriety of conduct' or
is ‘moral duties'. This suspicion is confirmed by isolated hints
