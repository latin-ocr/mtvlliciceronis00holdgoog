Mancipium means (1)the formal purchase per aes et libram, or (a) the
property, right of absolute ownership‚ acquired by such purchase, so that
he can alienate it at pleasure‚ especially a slave. Hence Lucretius 111 971
says vitaque mancipio nulli datur, amrbarum, ie. nature gives none the
mancipium cx iure Quiritium, the full and absolute ownership of life;
she only lendslit, keeping the dominc-'nm to herself. Cp. Horace Epist. 11

By the ancient civil law things were divided into res mancipi and res
nec mancipi, i.e. ‘things which could‚’ and ‘things which could not be
acquired as absolute property.' To the former belonged lands‚ slaves, and
ordinary beasts of burden‚ such as horses, oxen, mules, &c Maine Ancient
