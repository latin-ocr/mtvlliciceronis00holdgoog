oi a popular opinion, and so did Panaetius likewise'. We are
informed by his pupil Poseidonias that he was t'ond of quoting
passages from the poets in his writings. His elegant and popular
style was reflected also in bis doctrine. He could scarcely indeed
have expected to extend a taste for Stoicism among the Roman

aristocracy ii he had preached to them pure Zenonian wisdom ,

and urged correspondin'g rules of living. We are not told in what
relation Panaetius'stood to such fundamental Stoic propositions
as t-drt ἰ’σα τὰ ἁμαρτήματα καὶ τὰ xaropddpara-propositions which
are as eagerly vindicated by Cicero Parad. 3, as that-dn μόνοιὸ
σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος καὶ πᾶς ὅφριαν μαίνεται-15 impugned de fin. lv c. 27 f :
but it is plain from the dc affairs that they exercised no influence
on his ethics; while, according to Cicero or. p. Mur. 29, 61, M.
Cato non disputandi causa, ut magna pars, sed ita uiuendi
professed the strictest Stoic tenetsz-—supientem gratia numquam
moueri, numquam cuiusquam delicto agnoscar& neminem miseri·
cordum esse nisi stultum et leuem, solos sapientes esse, si seruitutem
seruiunt, reges etc. Panaetius also gave no countenanee to the
Stoic dogma, that there was no evil but vice, as Cic. informs us
de lin. 1v 9, 23 :-cum ad Q. Tuberonem de dolore patiendo scn'beret,
quad esse caput debebat, si probari posset, nusquam posuit, non
esse malum dolorem, sed quid esset et quod, quantumque in eo
esset alieni, munde quae ratio esset perferendi ie. ‘there is no
passage in his hook on the subject of bearing pain addressed to
Q. Tubero, in which he has laid down, what should have been the
fundamental proposition had it been capable of prooi, that pain
is not an evil, but he has (only) defined the nature and qualities of
pain and how much it contains that is repugnant, and next the
proper way of bearing it.’ This statement accords with that oi
Diogenes Laertius⁴1 that Panaetius disputed the Stoic dogma oi
tbe all-sufficiency oi virtue for happiness, and also that oi Aulus
Gellius⁴² that he was not orthodox in hisviews of ἀναλγησία and
ἀπάθεια

To teach men morals, who have laults and are accordingly, in
the strict Stoic vicu, incorrigible fools and sinners, is in itseli
an incongruity, which however did not prevent either Zeno or
