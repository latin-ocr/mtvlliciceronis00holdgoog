multia annis nost] 184 years. C. Hostilius Mancinus was consul
nc. 137 with M. Aemilius lepidus Porcina and had the conduct of the
war against Numantia. Being defeated by the enemy he negotiated a
peace through the intervention of his quaestor Tib. Gracchus, but the
senate refused to recognise it and delivered the consul over to the enemy
by means of the filiales. This was done with the consent of Man·
cinus, but the enemy refused to accept him. On his return to Rome
Mancinus took his seat in the senate, as heretofore‚ but was expelled
violently from it by the tribune P. Rutilius, on the ground that he had lost
his citizenship. His civic rights were restored to him by a special lex
