Introduction xxvii

e'n lze's libres secutus sum, reon interpretatus. But, on the other
hand, that he did follow Panaetius closely, especially in the First
Book-not only in the general arrangement of his subject and

in its leading ideas, but also in most of the details, as in his
choice of examples and ostentimes even in his expression—this

is partly sels-evident, partly a just inserence from the method
in which the ancients generally, and Cicero himself in his other
writings, were accustomed to employ their sources ; though in this
treatise, which was specially regulated by and suited to Roman
ideas, he shows more independence than in his larger philo·
sophicalworks. ’ ,

In the very beginning (5 1ο) of the First Book-which treats
of the honestum (τὸ καλόν), subdivided into the four cardinal
virtues—Cicero finds fault with the incompleteness of Panaetius’s
division of his subject, and his omission of the question duobus
proposieheenesth utrum honestius. Cicero discusses this subjectos
a conflict between particular virtues independently, from cn, xliii
152 to the end, in a cursory manner indeed and not without
adaptingPoseidonius (CH. xlv 159). But we shall not be doing him
an injustice, if' we assume that, apart from certain additions and
even omissions, he has in his First Book really reproduced the
substance of the corresponding part of Panaetius’s work. Even in

his discussion ¹of such questions as that of the superiority of · ’

res bellicae or urbanae (etl. xxii 74), he has probably done nothing
more than embellish it with examples from Roman history: and
again in the chapter about oratory the mention of rhetorum turbu
(§ 132) and of the Socratici (ἓ 134) is an indication that the senti-
ments presented to us are not altogether those of Cicero himself. It
would be very interesting to be ableto trace how much is Cicero's
own in the treatment¹ of the fourth cardinal virtue-curopociun
(qn. xxvii 93 ff). It is probable that here also he has really appro-
priated the code of precepts-which Panaetius drew up for the
use of the circle in which he moved-—on the subject of τὸ πρέπον.
Certainly the division of the subject is not Cicero’s own. No
more do such un-Stoic propositions as those on diversities of
individual character and their claims on us (CH. xxx 107 n), in
which only Roman examples are first quoted in illustration, bear
the impress of originality, nor are they at all foreign to the views of

Paliauettiiiibecond Book, which treats of the utile, we have only to

glauce at such passages as CH. viii 26 ff„ call. xiii and much.
