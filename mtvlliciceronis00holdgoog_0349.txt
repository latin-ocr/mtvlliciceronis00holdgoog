11. eum etue tam 1111111 interesset] ‘when he had no longer any
personal interest in it) For his con uests in Gaul and victory over the
aristocratical party had freed him hom his debts and enriched him.
A curious mode on Cicero’s part of aggravating the charge against Caesar,
vin that he had nothing to gain by it, since this fact evidently frees him
from the imputation of personal motives. The interpolated MSS bave the
words cum zjtsiur intererat, tum inserted aiter cogitarat, which are un-
necessary.

1. t. tenta 11111111] Α harsh judgment eonceming Caesar. The
measure alluded to was equally wise and just, being an equitable adjust-
ment of claims between debtor and creditor, by making a proper allowance
for the change which the value of money had undergone during the civil
urars. Caesar himself justifies the measure bell. civ. 111 1 cam fides tota

qm aarum ante bellam fuissent, atque cao creditoribus darentur.

should have been used, but the introduction of the subjunctive in the inter·
vening clauses has led to the substitution of the subjunctive in this clause
