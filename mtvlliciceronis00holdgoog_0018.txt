xiv Introduction

nc. 44, after he had actually started for Greece but been driven
back by stress of weather. This allusion, however, does not fumish
us with the exact date of the composition of the present work,
because Cicero is here speaking only of his disappointment in not
having paid his intended visit to his son at Athens. We do not leam
from it when the book was actually finished Evidence of this must
be sought elsewhere.

There were two occasions in the year nc. 44 when Cicero
urbe relicto rura peragravit-one from the beginning of April
to the end of August, the other from October to the 9th of
December. The question arises, which of the two is meant in
111 i 1. His correspondence throws light upon this point. In
a letter to Atticus from his villa near Puteoli dated Oct. 25th
(An xv 13, 6) he tells his friend that he is busy with the work: Nos
hic φιλοοοφοῨΜεΝ (qnid enim aliurn-n sol περὶ τοῨ vaeri-
nowsoc magnifice explicemus npocomwoinewque Ciceroni, qno de
re enirn potins poterfilio? deinde oleo: quid quaeres? exstabit
opera peregrinationeshuius. On November the 5th he writes again
to Atticus² that he had then completed the two first books and was
engaged upon the third. To judge from the marvellous rapidity
with which Cicero composed his philosophica] writings‚ it is highly
probable that the Third Book was completed before his second
return to Rome and appearance in open opposition to Antonius.

This supposition will justify and account for the bitterness
of spirit to which the writer gives vent without reserve on every
opportunity-and opportunities were not wanting in a work so
thoroughly practical as this-and his lamentation overthe extinction
of freedom, and his own particular grievances. In his other works,
composed before and just after the murder of Caesar, he expresses

’Ate xvl ιτ, 4 τὰ περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, quatenns Panaetius, absolui
duobus: iilius tres suut, sed, cum initio divisisset ita, tria genem exquirendi
efficii esse, uuum, cum deliberemus honestum ou turpe sit, alterum, utile au
inutile, tertium, cum haec inter se pugnare videantm, quomodo iudi·
candum sit, qualis causa Reguli, redire honestum, manere utile, de duobus
primis praeclare disseruit, de tertio pollicetur se deinceps, sed nihil scripsit.
Eunt locum Posidonius persecutns est, ego antem eteius librum arcessivi et

expecto ; quem uelim cohortere et roges ut quam primum-‚⁸ iu eo est περὶ τοῦ
κατὰ περίστασιν καθήκοντος, Cicero appears to have received these τὰ

κεφάλαια before the middle of the month ς for he writes (14, 3) Athenodorum ,
