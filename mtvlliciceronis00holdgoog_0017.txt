it auus compared

LIKE the principal ol the strictly philosophical works ol Cicero¹,
the de officu's belongs to the close of his lise. It was written in the
interval between the death oi his beloved and only daughter Tullia Ι
in Feb. tac 45 and the end oi no 44.

The probable time of its composition is evident from several
allusions in the work itsell. The Dictator julius Caesar has
been murdered (1 viii 26, 11 vii 23, 111 iv 19). The Laetius de
amicitia and the two lost books de giorno-neither ol which are
to be found amongst his philosophical works enumerated in the
Introduction to the Second Book of the cie divinatione which we
know was published after Caesar‘s death-have already appeared.
Cicero is compelled by his dread os Antonius to keep away from
Rome and remain in the country, with the avowed object of
quitting Italy altogether (111 i 1). But towards the end of the
third Book he has abandoned this purpose and is e medio cursu
clara uoce aptatum reuocatus (111 iii 121). This, as Cicero himself
explains, alludes to his return joumey to Rome on Aug. 31st
