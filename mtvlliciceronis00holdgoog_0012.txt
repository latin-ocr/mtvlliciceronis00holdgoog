of the light afforded by it, Ι have supplemented the
present volume with a considerable number of noteS, the
value of which will, I have reason to hope, be considered
not disproportionate to their bulk.

I am indebted also to the kindness of Dr J. S. Reid,
Fellow and Tutor of Caius College, for revising the
proof sheets of the supplementary notes and adding ¹
some observations and corrections, which cannot fail to
enhance the value of this volume, as they are based
upon an accurate knowledge of Ciceronian Latin, in
which Dr Reid has few, if any, rivals.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

BOTH Text, Analysis and Commentary in the Third
Edition have been again subjected to a thorough
revision. In the explanatory notes I have found it
necessary to embody some sixty pages of new matter,
while of the old compression here, expansion there,
and, where superfluous or erroneous, excision has been
employed unsparingly3 numerous fresh illustrations have
been given and frequent reference has been made to
the Grammars of Zumpt, Madvig, Draeger‚ Kennedy‚
Key and Roby. A few notes will be found distin-
guished by the initials J. Ε. Β. Μ.; for these Ι am in·
debted to Professor Mayor of Cambridge.
