1. 29. recurrerentur] ‘asteraformal demand of satisfaction’ The
formal and public declaration of war was an indispensable preliminary to
it among the Romans. This declaration was either conditional or pure.
The conditional was when it was made curn rerum repetitione, ‘a formal
demand for the restoration of the things in question‚' on the expiration of
33 days. This was called clarigatio (Liv. 132, 1v 3ο, vn 6, X τε, XXXVI
3). A pure declaration (indictio) was without any condition, as when an
injury could not be redressed; or when war was first declared by the other
party. See Grotius de Iure Belli ae Pacis 111 c. 3, ἓ 7 (Vol. 111. p. 62,

ed. Whewell). Comp. Liv. xxxvl 3 where the jetebles before the war with ’

the Aetolians give out antoniam renuntiatam videri, cum legatis⁴ totiens
repetentibus res nee reddi nec satisfieri aequum censuissent.

denuitatum et mulctum] ‘given notice of and declared.‘

1. 30. eopfflus] M. Popilius Laenas, consultae. τηε, was sent with
an army against the Ligurian mountaineers‚ whom he conquered after great
slaughter. See Liv. XL 7. Baiter, Hand and recent editors agree with
Lund in considering the whole of this passage as spurious. Popilius impe·
rator (without any praenomen) tenebat provinciam is vague and not like a
Latin expression. Again in ξ 37 Marci quedem Catonis senis would scarcely
have been written, if reference had just before been made to the same per·
son. Poo'tur-ooliget is grammatically incorrect: priore anteisse is a strange
phrase to express the ‘voidance of a former oath: as also is belluni nronere
(Gr. κινεῖν τὸν πόλεμον) in the sense os bellum incipere. Moreover,
adeo for nsque eo is not according to Ciceronian usage. See Hand Tursel-
linus tp. 152, N'agelsbach lat. stit p. 556 ed. a.

133. urmtut] ‘discharged’

Ρ. 10, §az 1. 3. est] ‘is extant‚' 11 ξ 16. Plutarch quaest. Rom. c.
39, alludes to the same letter: διὰ τί τοῖς μὴ στρατευομένοις μὲν, ἐν στρατο-
πέδῳ δέ ἄλλως ἀναστρεφομένας, οὐκ ἐξῆν ἀνδρα βαλεῖν πολέμιον, οὐδὲ τρῶσαι;
καί τοῦτο Κάτων ἀ πρεσβύτης ἐν ἐπιστολῇ τινι δεδήλωκε, γράφων πρὸς τάν
otti καί κελεύων, εί παρεθείη πῆς στρατείας ἀποπληρώσας τάν χρόνον, ὑποστρί·
φειν· ἠ προσμένοντα λαβεῖν παρὰ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ τὸ ἐξεῖναι τρῶσαι καί ἀνελεῖν
πολέμιον. Πότερον ὅτι τὴν ἀνάγκην μόνην ἐξουσίαν είναε δεῖ rori ἀνελεῖν
ἀνθρωπον· ὁδ’ ἀνευ νόμον καί προστάγματος τοῦτο ποιῶν ἀνδροφόνος ἐστίν ;

1. a. bello Persico] not ‘the Persian war,’ as it has been translated,
but ‘the war with Perseus or Perses,' the last king of Macedonia, who
was defeated and taken captive by Paulus Aemilius nc. 168. After the
battle of Pydna, the northern part ot' Grecce was made into a province,
under the name of Macedonia, as the southern part had been under the
name of Achaia after the taking of Corinth by Mummius, ἕ 35 l. 15. The
clauserunt in Macedonio—esset is rejected by Zumpt on the ground os the
improbability that the son of Cato should have been discharged by Popi-
lius and again five years later by Aem. Paulus. He would therefore refer
the statements of this section to the occasion before spoken of, ἓ 36.
