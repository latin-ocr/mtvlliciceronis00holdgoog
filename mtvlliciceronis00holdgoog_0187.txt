tto. nemausus tumemus] Demetrius ὀΦαληρεῦς, so called from
his birthplace, the Attic δῆμος, where he was born about ac. 345.
He was educated, together with the poet Menander, in the School of
Theophrastus. He began his public career about tae. 325, and soon
acquired a great name by his public speaking. As he acted thoroughly
in the spirit ol Phocion he was made governor of Athens by Cassander
Β. e. 317, an office which he filled for ten years (Atheniensium remp.
exsanguem iam et sistentem sustentauit Cic. de rep. 1152). Asterwards,
becoming intoxicated with his extraordinary good fortune, he abandoned
himself to every kind of dissipation, which roused aparty oi malcontents,
so that on the approach ol Demetrius Poliorcetes to Athens he fled to
Thebes and thence to the coortos Ptolemy Lagi at Alexandria, where he
devoted himself to literary pnrsuits (Plutarch, de exii. p. 602 1³),and died
tac. 283. His numerous writings (a list oi which is given by Diogenes
Laertius v 8ο) embraced subjects ol the most varied kinds; he was the
last among the Attic orators worthy os the name (Cic. Brut. 8, Quintil. x

itaque delectabat magis Atherdeuses quam inflammabat: processerat enim

doctissimi hominis anthraculis. Hic primns inflexit arationem et eam mollem

medium between the sublime grandeur ol Demosthenes 'and the flourisbing
