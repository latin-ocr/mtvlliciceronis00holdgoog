xxx Introduction

For when we remember that Cicero for his Third Book sent for
a Poseidonius and got his materials from Athenodorus Calvus the
Stoic (see lntrod. p. viii), and consider that it is hardly likely that
he should have had in his possession a copy of the work of Hekatdn
-whom he never mentions elsewhere—much less that he should
have had one at hand in his country house-we may fairly conclude
that he was satisfied with the bellum ὑπόμνημα of Athenodorus,
who contented himself with simply making extracts from Hekatdu,
and possibly supplied the notice also of Antipater of Tyre at the
end of the Second Book

And how has Cicero worked up his material? Obviously in a
. cursory and superficial manner. While in the First and Second
Books he has not shown indifference to the due arrangement of
his subject-its several divisions and subdivisions-though with
characteristic but unintentional want of precision3 in the Third
Book he abandons all such systematic treatment, andin the first
passage (d 96) where mention is made of a classification, he
bungles so completely that some editors, jealous of his reputation,
pronounce it to be spurious. After the usual introduction concern·
ing his personal position, which has nothing to do with the con·
tents of the Book, he. speaks (in CH. ii) of the relation of Panaetius to
the subject. He then explains how far, according to Stoic prin-
ciples, there can be any question of a conflict between moral
rectitude and expediency. From ξ 19 to the eud of CH. vi he
considers the general rule for the determination of such cases,
and gives examples in illustration thereof. After a pretty full
discussion of the subject, we are surprised all at once by the turn
it takes: Eius modi igitur credo res Panaetium persecuturum
fuisse, uisi aliqui casus aut occupatio eius consilium peremisset,
from which we see that Cicero regarded the preceding discussion
as merely introductory, to be followed up afterwards by the actual
treatise, as if the subject had not been already so far exhausted
that the part of it, which was most essential for arriving at a
decision, had been thoroughly sifted From cn. vii onwards there
is no attempt at arrangement or connexion of thought, and we are
not told by the writer until d 96 that in this Book, as in the other
two, the four cardinal virtues have been taken as the basis of his
proof, and that he has already dealt with the first two—pmdence
and justice. Instances of his defective reasoning may be seen in
ξ 14‚§ 17, ξ 27, ξ 88 and§ 102, and his illustrative examples are
not always relevant, see ξ 114, ξ 117. The whole Book in short
