tae. 135, a pupil of Panaetius. He was a native of Apamea in Syria, but
lived at Rhodes. Strabo calls him ἀνὴρ τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς φιλοσόφων πολυμα-
decreras: Cicero, who received instruction from him when he visited
Rhodes, de fin. r, a, styles him vel omnium Stoicomm maximum (1115 10,
de nat. d. 1 5 7, 5 123), and thought so highly os his powers that he
requested him to write an account oi his consulship, as a most notable
philosopher, to visit whom Pompei. on his return from the Asiatic war,
went to Rhodes. He was a man oi extensive and varied acquirements in
almost all departments of human knowledge, as a minute enquirer. He is
scarcely ever mentioned without some expression oi affection, and Cicero
tells us that he read his works more than those oi any other author. At
a later period he became a resident at Rome and stayed in Cicero’s house.
The fragments of his numerous writings were collected by J. Bake and
published at Leydeu 1810. See Introd. 5 30.
