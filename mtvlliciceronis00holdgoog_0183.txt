BOOK THE FIRST

ΒΕ omens] Gr. περὶτοῦ καθήκοντος, more rarely περὶ καθηκόντων, as
in Lucian Hermat. 582, Aul. Gell. N. Α. 1. c. 13. Cicero tells us himself
why he prefers the title arabim} to οἰνορἳο (Ep. ad Attia xvt 11, 5 al,
rel περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, quaterem Panaetius, absolvi duabus...de de
inscriptione quaenb, nan dubito quin καθῆκον ο fficium sit, nisi quid tu
aliud; sect inscriptio plenior‘de officiis! Προοφωνῶ autem Ciceroni pllio.
Virum estnon ἀνοίκειον. It agrees better with Cicero's treatment o the
subject of ‘moral duties,' inasmuch as these vary with a man's social position
and other circumstances which he considers in this treatise‚ see 1 5 raa-
125. compare also 1115 77 virann bonum...cum ea res innumerabilibus
officiis et laudibus contineretur.

CHAPTER I.

1³. ³5 1,1.1. aunum tam numentum] Cicero sent his son to Athens
about the first of April ue. 45. as he tells usin a letter to Atticus written
the next year (xv 15), in which speaking of bis son he writes scn'psit ad
Tironem sibi post Kal. April.—sic enim annuum tempus confici-nebel

datum esse. As Cicero speaks in the text of his son annum iam audr'entem

Cratippum, it is inferre that he began this Treatise in the spring or early
in the summer of lac. 44, two or three months at most after the assassina·
tion of Caesar. On the other hand, the following reasons may be given
for believing that the treatise was not commenced until the autumn of the
tltltt‘l lllltltltltttillltttttstltttt‘llaltltltlt03
of a work de affictis until Oct. 24 (Ep. ad Att. xv 13). (ο) Cicero implies
(Off 1115121) that this book was intended as a substitute for the instruc·
tion which he had designed giving his son in person at Athens. It may be
supposed therefore that it was written after the project of visiting Greece
was abandoned. Now we leam from Ep. ad An. xvt ythat having set
out on a voyage, he was driven back to the vicinity of Rhegium on the 6th
of August, and was induced to give u his visit to his son and return to
Rome by the representations of his liiends that a favourable change in
public affairs had taken place, and that his presence was demanded. He
reached the Capitol on the last day of August, and having on September
the and delivered his first Philippic, retired soon after to his villa at
Puteoli. Here he spent the months of October and November, and is sup·
posed to have employed himself in writing this work. It is agreed that it
was finished before the ninth of December. A. W. Zumpt suggests that
the disagreement may be reconciled by supposing that the young Cicero,
although he left home on the first of April, id not for some time actuahhy
commence his attendance on the instructions oi Cratippum auh tuanen.
ebat Cicero does not intend to speak with exactness iu using tius. *¹0¹5* .
