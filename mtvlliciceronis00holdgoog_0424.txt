1. 11. commutata utilitate] ‘by a change oi expediency,’ ie. when the
purposes they were intended io serve are reversed, 5 71.

Mt. w-quidem] 565 l. 9, Hand Turs.1p. 502.

de 1111 quae-utilitates] ‘oi those objecta which appear to be expe·
dient under a mask os wisdom, but really are opposed 1ο justice? On the
plural utilitates see 15 78 note.

1. it. aed quoniam a qumaor 111] On the deficiency ο1 this classi·
fication and the carelessness shewn in subjoining it here for the first time
see Introd. 5 39, cp. i 5 117. We may remark suriher, that this supple·
mentary division inserted here, which occurred io Cicero probably only
while writing, obliges him to repeat what he said above ac de iis malens,

e videntum-arbitror dictum 111 the words ac de pudentia qu' em cet.

e words 5 71 quocirca astutiae tollendae suut eaque malitia, vuit
illa idem videri se esse prudentiam are generallyr ded as tidadnd oi
the 111 section on false prudence. Yet Cicero would ave ex ressed him·
seli more distinctly ii he had meant to distinguish the exampies 110111 one
another in this mannen at any iate in all cases, where apparente i·
ency is preferred to virtue, injustice as well 11 1 ‘misconception ο true
expediency and therefore salse prudence shews itself3 accordingly they are
not easily distinguished from each other. The followi examples likewise
shew a conflict ο1 expediency with justice more than wiigh high mindedneas.
Still all this does not amount to a reason for pronouncing the words ac de
prudentia-tmperontme 1ο be an interpolation, as many do. For the '
words sed quoniam-uirtutis inimica could only form the transition to the
next division, which is to treat oi the conflict between high-mindedness and
expediency, on the supposition that uirtus=magnitudo animi. As it is,
Cicero never uses uirtus in contradistinction to iustitia. Even ii' virtus
had this sense here, the point would have been missed: because we derive
duties srorn four kinds os virtue, we shall have to deal with the same four
kinds ο1 virtue, when we treat os the conflict between expediency and
high-mindedness. Finally, ii the first division treated oi the conflict be-
