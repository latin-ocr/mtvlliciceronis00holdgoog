any share in forging the will) sufficient to absolve them lrom being thought
to have done wrong? No; in my opinion it is n0t; thoughl always loved
one os them (Hortensius, 11 ἕ 57), while he lived, and am no enemy to
the other, now that he is dead and gone) Cicero's liking for his rival
Hortensius is attributed by Cornelius Nepos (vit. Art 5) to their corn·
mon iriendsbip with Atticus ut intellegi non posset, uter eum plus diligeret,
Cicero an Hortensius: et iet, quod erat difficillimum, efficiebat, ret inter
quos tantae lawi's esset aemulatio, nulla intercederet obtrectatio essetque
toltum mironem copula. Hortensius after the coalition oi Pompey with
Caesar and Crassus (nc. 60) withdrew from public lile and confined hirn-
self to his duties as an advocate3 be died sc„ 50. Once only alter his
retirement did be appear in public, viz. ne. 55, to oppose the sumptuary
law of Pompey and Crassus, the repeal of which he obtained. For Crcero's
sentiments towards Crassus see ep. ad sam. 1 9, ao cum me disputan·

charged him with complicity in the Catalinarian conspiracy, Plut. Crass.

Clodius, Cicero’s bitterest enemy, and bad prevented his condemnation
(ad Att. 1 16, 5), and therefore had neither opposed Cicero’s banish·
ment nor worked lor his return. Still Crassus sought to be reconciled
with Cicero aster his return (Plut. Cic. 33), andan apparent reconcilia-
tion took place between them before Crassus’ departure for Asia: ad
fam. ibid. cum Pompeius etei contendisset, ut nihil umquam magis, ut cum
Cras so redirem in gratiam-hobal non temporem solum rationem meorum,
sedetiam naturae, Crassusque, ut quasi testata populo Romano esset nostro

trianus. He was a consederate of Antonius, spoken oi contemptuously
by Cicero Phil. 11 ἕ 107 as patronus os Italian townships: vexavit (Anto-

silum vi et erneis et alios vestri similes, quos clientes nemo halem velit, non
