L 4. Bardulle,V1rlathue] they are designated as robbers by Cicero
because they waged a kind of guerilla warfare and not one in the interest of
civilisation. Bardulis is called by Diodorus xvi 4 King of the Illyrians.
He waged war with Perdiccas 111. of Macedonia and his younger brother
Philip by whom he was defeated. Viriathus, the celebrated Lusitanian
hero, a man of humble origin, who from a guerilla chieftain rose to be his
country's champion against the Romans. His extraordinary successes
against the enemy were obtained tae. 148-146. Gaius Laelius kept the
field against him, but Gaius Plautius and after him Claudius Unimanus were
vanq'uished ; Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus was more successful.
but, when his successor the praetor Quintius took the command, the
Romans again suffered defeat after defeat, until Quintus Fabius Maximus
Seruilianus, the adopted brother of Maximus Aemilianus (Β. c. 140), restored
the fortune of war. But even after this success the Roman army was
attacked while besieging Erisane and defeated by Viriathus, who, how-
ever, contented himself, like the Samnite general at the Caudine pass, with
concluding a peace with Aemilianus, in which he was acknowledged as the
king of the Lusitanians. But Quintus Servilius Caepio, who had succeeded
his brother in the command os Further Spain, renewed the war and shortly
afterwards was base enough to procure the assassination of the Lusitanian
hhero by bribing three of his confidants. Mommsen, Hist. Rom· Book lv
