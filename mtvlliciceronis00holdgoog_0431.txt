ς 102. Grotius (11 p. 101) says, ‘that oaths to a faithless person are not
to be kept, if the swom promise had evidently respect to another promise,
which was a sort of implied condition; but they are to be kept is the
promises are of a diverse kind and without mutual reference: for then
each must observe what he has sworn.’

as spoiling the connexion, as quad enom ita cet. refers immediately to
uideant ne quaeratur latebra periurio. ln the preceding passage Cicero
was speaking of the ‘faithless man (trepidetis), not of an ‘enemy' More·
over an oath made to an enemy, whic bostis here means as is shewn by
ius bellicum, is binding at all times and not merely saepe. See s. n.
