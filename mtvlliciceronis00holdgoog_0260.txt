5 ua. liam quod Herculem Prodicus aar] lor as to the story told ol
Hercules by Prodicus, his case was different from ours: he was the son οἰ
· Jupiter, we are but ordinary mortals. On this use of nam see n. to 115 47.
Some read Herculem Predieium ‘the Hercules ol Prodicus,‘ i.e. such ashe is
represented by Prodicus. So Heraclea Xenophantacse ist. ad lam. v ra,
Terentianus Phormio pro Caecln. 5 27, Terentianus C remes above 5 30,
seruc Caecilianus pro Rosc. Amer.⁸5 46. For notices of Prodicus in
ancient writers see my Onomast. Aristoph. p. 915 sq. The substance of
his lecture as given by Xenophon in the well-known ‘Choice ol Hercules’
was this: “When Hercules, entering upon manhood, was on the point of
choosing between virtue and vice, two women appeared to him, the one of
dignified beauty, purity, modesty, and discretion, the other of a voluptuous
form and meretricious look and dress. The latter promised to lead him
by the shortest road, without any toll, to the enjoyment of every pleasure.
The other, while she reminded him os his ancestors and his noble nature,
did not conceal from him that the gods have granted nothing really
beautiful and good without trouble or pain· Hercules decided in favour
of virtue. The episode has been paraphrased in English verse by Shen·
stone, and by Bishop Louth, and'there is a prose translation of it in the
‘Tatler' No. 97. Allusions to it are frequent in classical writers, eg. Sil.
Ital. Punic. xv 18-127, Lucian Somn. c. 6, Deor. dialog. xx rr, Her-
motimus c. 25.
