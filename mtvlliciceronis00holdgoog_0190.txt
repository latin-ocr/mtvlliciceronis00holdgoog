opened his school in the Portico adorned with the paintings of Polygnotus,

ἐν αὐτῇ τι εἶναι τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν (Diog. Laert- νυ ἕ 89), that the pleasure
arising from a life of virtue was its natural result (ἐπιγέννημα τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ)
¹und not the eud and aim of virtuous conduct. The Academics and Peripa·
tetics considered that though moral goodness (honoras) was the chief thing,
there were other things besides virtue to be desired in and for themselves as

l. 16. Aristonis, Pyrrhonis, Erilli] Aristo of Chius (nc. 260) and
Erillus of Carthage were Stoics, Pyrrho of Elis was the founder of the
school of the Sceptics. They agreed in considering all external things
indifferent (oldendune de fin.1v. 16, 53, Ac. 115 130), not to be rechoned
among things good or evil. 1. Pyrrho taught this by denying all grounds
of truth. For, if in the case of our objects of thought there is never any
reason for considering them, or any one of them, true rather than false,
then of course there is never any true ground for asserting that any external
object is good or a proper object of desire or preference. a. Aristo, like
Erillus, deviated from Zeno, their common reacher and the founder of
their sect. He rejected all parts of philosophy except ethics, and even
limited tlte domain of ethics itself, for he taught that its object is not to
treat of particular duties and encouragements to virtue, but that it is the
province of the philosopher to shew wherein the supreme good consists.
With Aristo nothing is of worth but virtue, nothing is evil but vice. He

ί seelrs to refute the opinion that there is such a difference in external things
that one is preferable to another (Ritter and Preller 358, Introd. 522).
3. Erillus, a pupil of Zeno, limits the surnmunr bonum of the Sage to
science (ἐπιστήμη) and knowledge. He considers practical life, which is
occupied about external things, as simply necessary and denies it to be
beautiful, on the ground that it does not contribute anything to the supreme
good. This principle, common to these three philosophers, strikes at the root
of practica] morality: it takes away all dilectus rernm, ‘difference (or power
of choosing) between things, all materials for virtue to act upon,' hy which
means there is left no aditus ad inventionem officii, ‘no way of finding out
what is our duty.’ For how can that Prudence, which is seen in wisely
choosing oue thing before another, have any place, if all things are equally
in themselves indifferent? And if there be no difference between siclrness
and health, riches and poverty,¹ and it is as good for a man to be in one as
in th'e other of these, this takes away all obligations of assisting those that
are in sickness or want, seeing that, according to this opinion, they are not
any wisc in a worse condition than the healthy or rich. And by conse-
quence, all justice and Beneficence, etc. must fall to the ground. Comp.
