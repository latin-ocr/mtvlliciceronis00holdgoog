NOTES Boot< 11 cxrx §565—67 297 ,

Ηε was the most celebrated jurist of his time (Mucius Scaevola was a little
oldest: his excellence as a lawyer is specially recorded by Cicero in a pas-
sage of the Brutus ἕ 153 ltr'e enim attulit banc artem oninium artium
maximam (scientihc treatment), quasi lucem ad ea, quae confuse ab aliis
aut respondebantur aut agebantur. In 110. 51 he was elected consul with
Cl. Marcellus. When Cicero defended Murena, Sulpicius was one of the
prosecutors. ·

ts. superiores] ‘hispredecessors’
uolentia] ‘in legal lore’

ξοδ, 1. 6. aanor [gravior] resultas] The word grauior loolrs
very like an interpolation, originallya u. l. of gratior. Zumpt, however,
retains it with this explanation: ‘gravior quidem quoniam minusad subti-
litates ipris privati descendit, sed vel contra has, si opus sit, gravitate sua
pugnat.

1. a. rel admiratione aumantium rel spe magunum] ‘in respect
of the admiration of those who listen to it, or the expectation of those who

need it, or the gratitude of those who have been defended by it.’ For the
double ablative cf. ς 58.

p· 310. 111 tora dignitatis emanatus] i. q. p. d. in pacis artibus,
‘the first rank among civil professions‚' 1 ἕ 77. The same sentiment occurs

de orat. 1 5 15 erant autem huic studio (eloquentiae) inmota, quae nuru
quoque sunt, exposita praemia vel od gratiam uel ad opes uel ad dt'gnitotem.

1.11. taosse laborantis] i. e. libenter, ‘one who readily, willingly,
takes pains,’ 5 75 l a 3, ep. ad Att. x11 34, r ego bic uel sine Sicca facillime
possem esse, utin malis, x111 26, ciocum babeo nullum, ubi facilius esse
possim quam Asturae.

our forefathers‚’ in reference to gemuito defendentis.

1.1a non meato] ‘without reluctance.’

et mrum] ‘and with no remuneration,' i. e. siue ullo honorario
vel palmaria. In early times (in patriis moribus) no patronus used to take
a fee from his client, but, as this custom fell into disuse, a compulsory law
(lex Cincio muneralis) was passed (ac. 204) by M. Cincius Alimentus
tribune of the commons, which enacted ne quis ob causam orandam pecu-
niam donumve acez'piat‚ desen. ἓ ro, Tac. ann. 111 5, xm 42, xv ao, Liv.

ὅσον ἂν λάβωσιν, ἐκτίνειν ἐκέλευσεν. In Cicero's time it was not unusual to
receive a palmarium. So in the Paradoxa vt a, 46 among the character-
istics of the bomo quaestuosus his mercedum pactiones in patrociniis are
especially named.

ς 07, 1.14. admonebat me res ut oet.]=re admonente deplorabam:
‘my subject was very nearly suggesting to me...only etc.’ An indic. past
tense is used in apodosis to express an action begun, but hindered by
another action which appears in a conjunctive protasis with nisi, orsi.

as Brut. ἓ ar, ς 157, ἓ 331.
