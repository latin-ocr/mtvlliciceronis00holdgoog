Presace ‘xi

enlarged and improved edition of that before published

by Unger. I have found great assistance frorn his corn-
mentary, which leaves few difficulties unnoticed. The
Introduction prefixed to this edition is substantially
a translation of his Einleitung. However much the
possession of these aids and appliances has diminished
editorial work, the mere task of selection and com-
pression of materials‚ easy as it may appear to those
who have had no experience of it, is a constant strain
upon the judgment which requires no inconsiderable
expenditure of tirne and labour.

Wherever the actual words of the annotator have
been quoted, Ι have given his name: where the derived
notes have undergone a change of form, I have not
made any special acknowledgment of the original
source frorn which they are taken. In the text Ι have
followed for the most part the recension of Orelli's
Cicero by Baiter and Halm, which must at present
be considered the standard edition. In some passages,
where a different reading has commended itself to my
judgment, I have given that of Baiter in the adnotatio

critica, and in any variations of importance added the Ἰ

readings of the principal editors
