xxxii Introduction

⁸ Herbipolitanus (H), a MS oi the Xth century 11 the library 01
Wiirzburg, collated by Halm and Ε. Popp· This MS also agrees very
closely with b and is probably copied from it, retaining most of its errors.

To the Second or inferior class os MSS, viz. those interpolated
by the writers, belong the following :-

Beruenses 1 and 0 (10. 104), 01 the Xth and XIIIth centuries
respectively‚ both collated by Halm: the first is of little or no value
because of the number of arbitrary corrections and interpolations in it.

Harleianus(1·) 10. 1716 11 the British Museum‚ written at the end
of the IXth or the beginning of the Xth century, collated by Augustus
Luchs. This MS is much mutilated. The Third Book begins with ch.
xxt ἓ 85 10111 persuasum esse debet, and there are several leaves missing
aster this. It seems to have once belonged to J. G. Graevius.

Palatinus (p) no. 1531, oi the XIIth century, collated by Ernest Popp,
who in his inaugural dissertation, Erlangen 1883, de Ciceronis de ffciis
librorum codicibus 1111111111ι 104 eique cognatis, has shown the intimate con·
nexion subsisting between 1·,c and p, and their derivation irom one and
the same source. Critics are at issue conceming the value of this second
class 01 MSS, but there can be 10 doubt of their use ior correcting some
occasional errors and filling up gaps which are common to the first;
as Zumpt says os 0 quamue}r nec 1111111111 nec falsis correctionibus prorsus
careat, tamen enoendandi textus Ciceronioni som est uberrimus. Thus in
1 ἐ 154 for reapse 0 has 11 ab 11, while the better MSS have re ipsam has
the arbitrary correction ab ipsa 11. In11 ἓ 53 the words (p. 801. 11
goarem sore? Bene nrinistrum et praebitorem, which in the first recension
are wanting—the woriter having obviously let his eye vander from the
first to the second praebitorem and so omitted the intermediate clause-
have to be supplied from MSS 01 the second recension. This is only one
of many instances that could be adduced. There can be no doubt then
that 0, considered as a representative of the second class, was copied from
a MS in many places more correct than that which served as the copy for
the first or better class of MSS. But it by no means follows from this that
011 more trustworthy than the latter, as R. Stuerenburg considers 11 his
edition 01 the de officiis, Leipzig 1843, ed. o.

Ambrosianus (tt) pressmarlc F 41 sup, written on parchment in
the Xllth century, classed as a secandary of the first group by Sabbadini.
A collation 01 its readings is given by Schiche. The MS is remarkable
ior the number oi its contractions, sor its omissions and transpositions.
There are corrections by a second hand osan apparently early date, and by
a third much more recent. It agrees with B more osten than with other
MSS, and, though it has certain points oi contact with p, it is independent
01 the whole group to which p belongs. Ι1 sact it occupies an isolated
position oi its own between the two principal classes.
