anacoluthon occurs 1 ξ 105.

1. 6. optumum auctorem] Any person who determines our belief, even
as awitness, is called an auctor. Thus Tacitus Germ. c. 28, in quoting Julius
Caesar as a witness with respect to the former state of the Gauls, calls him
summus auctarum, i.e. ‘the highest of authorities: . below, ἕ 113 Poly·
διἰις, banus auctor in primis, Hor. Od. 1 ιδ, 14 (Pyt agoras) non sordidus
auctor naturae verique. As writers, particularly of history, were the
authorities for facts, ‘auctor' came to mean ‘a writer.' Hence Juvenal
sat. vn 23¹ speaks ofa preceptor of the Roman youth being required ut
legat historias, auctores noverit onmes tamquam ungens digfwsqus suas.

λδ. sed] resumptive after a digression, ‘but,' ‘however,' ‘be that
asitmay,’1§4‚§1o5‚11§73.

smmum eum moadiae] The tragic poets, especially Euripides,
like to represent Odysseus as crafty and full of intrigue and cowardly‚ and
so they frequently employ this myth, eg. Sophocles, in his play Ὀδυσσεὺς
μαινόμενος, Euripides frequently, and amongst the Romans Accius and Pacu·
vius in his Armorum iudicium.

right in bracketing these words as an interpolation. Ae alone isused to

1.18. ab Aiace] in the Armorum iudicium of Pacuvius, from which
the lines here quoted are taken. The person spoken of is Odysseus, the
speaker Ajax. There is a play by Accius also so called.

t ts. attus lpse—fldem] ‘he was the only one to set aside the
obligation of the cath, which he was himself the first to take, as all of you
know.’ Cuius is to be taken as a monosyllable (Hermann elem. metr. 1
10, 29), istius l. 23 as a dactyl with the elision of the final s. For the
allusion see Apollodorus Biblioth. 111 ro, 9 τούτων (τῶν μνηστευομένων)
