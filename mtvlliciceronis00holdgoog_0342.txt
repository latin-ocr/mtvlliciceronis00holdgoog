1. 1. tributum] ‘a property tax,’ being a percentage levied upon the
fortune of each Roman citizen, as rated hythe censors: its proceeds were
chiefly applied to provide sor the expenses os war (Liv. 1v 60, v 10, vt 32).
There had been no occasion to levy a tributum since the subjugation of
Macedonia by Paullus Aemilius Β. c. 167, by which the treasury was well
replenished (5 761. 4). All tolls also (portoria) had been discontinued
since Pompey’s victory over Mithridates rae. 60, according to the pro·
visions of the Lex Caecilia euacted by Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos.
Cicero’s presaga, that there might be an occasion for renewing these burdens
upon the citizens, was fullilled in the year following, B. c„ 43, when a war
tax was laid upon the people‚ the treasury having been impoverished by
the frequent demands made upon it by Caesar and Antony, Sueton. Caesar

Madvig thinks ita or sic required in the former, Wesenberg reads ita in
the latter ol the passages quoted. Translate: ‘I had rather say so than
sorebode evils to our own commonwealth.' Observe that the first part ol
the arenthesis-malo enim ita quarn nostraeomiuari-refers to alicui rapu
in tie second part he recalls the words which he has just uttered, as un·
called lor, because he is speaking of the state in general and not of any state
in particular.
