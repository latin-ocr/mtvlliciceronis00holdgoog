versity alike (Diog. Laert. 11 ῦόῆν δὲ ίκανδς ἁρμόσασθαι καί τόπῳ καί
χρόνῳ καί προσώπῳ καί πᾶσαν περίστασιν ἁρμονίως ὑποκρίνασθαι). Hence
Horace says (Ep. 1 1,18)t0 observe his precepts is rnilri res, nou mc
rebus subiungere, and (1 ιγ, 23) ononis Aristippum decuit coloret status
et res. To Xenophon and Plato he was very obnoxious. Aristotle too
calls him a sophist. The Cyrenaics divided philosophy into five parts,
viz. the study of (1) objects of desire and aversion, (ο) leelings and
affections, (3) actions, (4) causes, (5) prools.

1. ln the first alone ol these divisions isthe Cyrenaic view connected ¹
with the Socratic. Aristippus taking up the Socratic position that
happiness (i. e. the enjoyment ol a well-ordered mind) is the aim ol all
men, pronounced leasure the chiel good and pain the chief evil, the
τέλος oi human lise to be momentary pleasure (μονόχρονος, μερικιλλι
present happinesstheresore was to be sought, arrd not εὐδαιμονία, which
is the sum ol a number of happy states. ln this point the Cyrenaics
were opposed to the Epicureans. All pleasures were considered equal: so
that a man should never covet more than he possesses and never let him·
sels be overcome by sensual enjoyment. Even with these concessions the
Cyrenaic system destroys all moral purity, by proposing to a man as many
separate τέλη as his lite contains moments.

2. Pleasure and pain are both positive, both motions ol the soul (ἐν

3: Actions are in themselves morally indifferent, and made good aud
bad only by law and custom. Whatever conduces to pleasure, is virtue.

4. Knowledge is sensation and πάντων μίτραν ἅνθρωπος.

ceris was probably a contemporary οἱ Alexander the Great; he forms a
link between the Cyrenaic and Epicurean schools. He was opposed to
Epicurus in two points: (r) he denied that pleasure was merely the absence
of pain, lor if so death would be a pleasure; and (a) he attributed to eve'ry
separate act a distinct object, maintaining that there was no general end of
human lise. He diflered from Aristippus, inasmuch as he allowed that
friendship, patriotism and similar virtues were good in themselves. Dict.
of Biogr. 1 p. 180. ot δὲ Ἀννικέρειοι καλούμεναι ἐκ τῆς Κυρηναϊκῆς δια·

Hence Cicero speaks os Epicurus as ciusdem fere auctor adiutorque seu·
tentiae (Diogen. Laert. 1189). His sect became so completely out of date
(quibus obsoletis) after Epicurus’ time, that no mention is made of them by
any succeeding writers, such as Ammonius, Alexander Aphrodisiensis.
