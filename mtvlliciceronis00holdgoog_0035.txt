, There is no lack ol MSS oi the present work, but it is
remarkable that only a lew ol these have been sufficiently collated
to enable us to pronounce upon their worth. It is quite possible “
that there may be others in existence, in comparison with which
those hitherto made use oi are of subordinate value. Such as are
known are neither better nor worse than the average MSS of
other classical authors. lt is easy to see that they descend from
one archetype, like so many other MSS of ancient classics, by
the interpolations common to them all such as aut Aristides in
lll iv ἓ 16, transpositions such as that in p. 931. 1 where see note,
or other equally manifest errors and oversights. But the text ol this
archetypus codex has come down to usin a double recension.
To the F irst, in which Cicero's words have not been tampered with,
belong the better MSS, which date from the Xth century :-

Beroensis (b) collated by Leonard Uster and subsequently by
J. G. Baiter and Ernest Popp. It is thus described by Emile Chatelain
in his Pollograpltie des classiques Latins p. ra Planche XLV. ‘Berne
Bibliotheque de la ville no. 391. Ecriture du tx· sikele. Volume de
40 leuillets, designe par b dans Orelli. Il porte la signatore d'un ancien
possesseur: Aem. Ranconeti (le pre'sident Aimar de Raoconet, mort
prisonnier a la Bastille en 15 59).’

[Chatelain gives lac-similes oi three other ancient MSS; two in the
Bibliothtque nationale at Paris, Latin 6601 and 6602, written respectively
in the lXth and Xlth centuries, and a third Vossianus Q. 71 in the
University Library ol Leyden, in writing of the IXth century; neither
the first nor the last are mentioned in Orelli’s edition r but the last appears
to bave been examined by E. Hedicke in 1879.]

Ambrosianus (A) in the Library at Milan, C. 29 ini.. a parchment
MS of the Xth century, collated by J. G. Baiter and F . Eyssenhardt.
lt bears a close resemblance tob.

Bambergensis (B), also a parchment MS, ol the Xth century, collated
by K. Halm, very like l) but lreer from errors.
