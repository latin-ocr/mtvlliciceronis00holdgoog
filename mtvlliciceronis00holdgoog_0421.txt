jacere ut rursus habeat venditor quod tarnem. The act of returning an
object under these circumstances was called redhibitio, and a suit brought
to compel the seller to receive the object and to retum the price was actm
redhibitoria and so iudicium redhibitorium. See Quintil. inst. or.

1. 9. furacem] fierax, ‘thievish,' merely marks the slave’s character and
therefore is not so strong a word as fur, which would imply that the
slave had been tried and found guilty of theft and therefore could not be
warranted by the seller. There is no inconsistency between this sentence
111171 qui scire debuit-de furtis, praestat edicto aedilium. If a slave
manifested a thievish disposition by stealing from his master, it was not
necessary to declare it when he was offered for sale. But if the owner of a
slave, when he offered him for sale, eoncealed the fact that the slave had
made his master liahle for damages by stealing from a third person, he was
responsible and might be required to talre the slave back. Marcion dig.
