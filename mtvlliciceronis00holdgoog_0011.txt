PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH EDITION

, THE demand lora new impression ol the Sixth
Edition has given me the opportunity ol introducing
a few changes in the plates containing the Text, which
now agrees very nearly with that of C. F. W. Miiller
in his annotated Edition, (Teubner, Leipzig, 1882),
which itself does not differ rnuch frorn that given in his
Edition with critical Notes in the Teubner Classical
Series, 1879.

The Introduction has been entirely re·written and
includes tlie substance of the same Editor's Eirzleitung.
