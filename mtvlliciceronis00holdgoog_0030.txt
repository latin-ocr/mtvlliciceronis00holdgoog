xxvi · Introduction

Chrysippus from discoursing on moral duties; but Panaetius and
his school not only took a less exalted view os general morality‚
descending to the level of common life, but they went so iar as
to enunciate principles which are questionable even according to
the vulgar notions of morality, as in 1 10, 32 nee promissa egitur
seruanda stent eo quae sint iis, quibus promiseris, inutilia, nec, si
plus tibi ea noceant, quam illi prosint cui promiseris, contra
officinm est maius oreteponi minore, and 11 14, 51 patroni estnon
numquam ueri simile, etiamsi minus sit verum, defendere, upon
which Cicero observes t-quod scribere,praesertim cum de philo-
sophia semborum, non auctorem, recti idem placeret gravissimo
Stoicorum Panaetio-and 111 29, 107 on mental reservation in
taking an oath. But there were other Stoics also hesore Pa·
naetius, who relaxed sonte of the rigour oi their school, as
appears srom the solution oi the problems adduced by Cicero
111 12, 51 ff and 23, 91 by Antipater oi TarsuS, a teacher of
Panaetius, and by his master Diogenes os Babylon,—the latter
of whom openly justified fraud and imposition.

We cannot be surprised that this modification of Stoicism
should have become sashionable at Rome, and Cicero needed no
special justification sor associating himself with the ethical teaching
of a school which had the reputation—however little deserved-os
making such strong claims on the morals of its adherents. The
necessity os living virtuous lives and avoiding vice was taught
by all schools alike ; they differed only as to the ‘why and where·
fore! The Stoics in their exalted notions of virtue and contempt
oi external things which they would not allow to he good, went
too sar for ordinary men, they made themselves only too good;
and their big phrases consequently were mere empty sounds, in
which no one believed.

We have Cicero’s own confession in several passages that
the treatise oi Panaetius aspi τοῨ raedrowroc was his seins
primarius in the present work; see especially 111 2, 7 quem nos
correctione quadam adnotata potissimum secuti sumus. To what
extent he drew upon his source, and what partos his work is
original, though we cannot follow it out in detail, we may form
a general notion. lt is true that he expressly guards in other
tpassages against the supposition that he merely translated the
¹original: Sequemur Stoicos, non ut interpretes, sect ut solemus,
e fontibus eorum iudicio arbitrioque nostro, quantum quoque modo
uidebitur, hauriemus 1 2, 6, and 11 17, 60 Panaetius, quem multum
