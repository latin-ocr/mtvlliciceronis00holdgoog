abargaim and through a mistakc to sall into very great harm, 11 'this is not

refusing to set a man right when he has lost his way (a thing scouted at
Athens cn pain 01 being publicly cumed), what else is?’

1. 3. execrationlbut publicu motum] ie. lege sacrata vetitum.
Sancire is ‘to enact' with the addition 11 1 penalty in case 01 disobedience.
Hence ‘to prohibit under penalty' 5 69. The law, which was traced back
to Buzyges (see schweighauser n. to Herod. v11 131, Leutsch append.
prov.. Gott. 161 ὁ γὰρ Βουζύγης Ἀθήνησιν o' τὸν ἱερόν ιίροτον ἐπιτελῶν ἄλλα

Athenae. v1 p. 138 (Meineke Com. 1140511111 note to 1 5 5¹ l 6,
Demosth. de 1. l. p. 314 1). [Haupt would read Buzygis ior publicis,

1. ⁶. attentatu] the subject of the general int, ‘knowingly to lead
another into error‚' 11 5 67, Roby Gr. 11 1314.

1. 8. proscripsit cet] 566 l. 11, ‘advertised 101 sale a thing which
he did not like‚' or (taking qnod as a conjunction) ‘his house, because he
did not like it.’ Proscribo is ‘to write down' the name of a thing o'n a
tablet (tabida 5 68, tabula auctionario Cat. 11 5 18), called also libellus,
album cr titulus, Tibull. 114, 54, Plin. ep. vu 11, 17 (whence ire sub
titulum = proscribi), and placard it. Hence its meaning ‘to proscribe’ See
Merivale's n. to Sallust Catil. c. 10. Inscribere amalr or mercede is used
in the same sense, Plaut. Trinumm. 1 1, 131 aedes venales hasce inscribit
litteris, cp. Ter. Hautont.1 1, 144 inscripsi illico aedes.

ts. villam-aedificatam] sc. vendo, which was commonly omitted

multo minus] sc. fefellerunt, 01 existimandi sunt fefellisse.

L 12. ubl iudicium emptoria cet] ‘where the buyer may exercise
his own judgment, what fraud can there be in that case on the part ol the
seller?’ Here again Diogenes holds hy the letter 11 the law. It is a sun-
‹lamental principle 11 Roman law that there be no outwitting‚ where the
buyer has the opportunity ol judging 101 himself. There is a statute
(Digest. 1111111 111. 1 dc contr. crept.) that ca quor commendandi causa in
condicionibus dicuntur, si palam appareant, vcrcdc'torcm non obligant (1.1.
do not oblige him to make good (praestare) his professions) veluti si dicat
‘servum speciosum‚‘ ‘domum benc aedificatam!

1.1a. sin autem] does not introduce an opposition to the ioregoing
supposition‚ but a conclusion based upon its adoption. Cp. 5 65, de div. 11
5 18 si enim scit, certe illud iverint, sin certe eveniet, nullo fortuna est, de
nat. deor. 111 5 46 quomodo autem potes si Latonam dcam putas, Hecatem
non putaret-sin haec deo est, cur non Eumenides?

dictum non omne praestandum est] ‘not all which is said (in praise
11 an article 01 sale) is to be made good? So praestare tidem ‘to make
good, 1. e. to keep, 0111111011.ι
