Introduction xxiii

strictest professor of Zeno’s doctrine, to wish to endeavour to be
virtuous. The proposition that virtue is not a quality (ἕξις) of
the mind which can be improved by practice, but an unchangeable
condition (διάθεσις τῆς ψυχῆς) which does not admit of increase or
decrease‚ capable of being possessed only wholly or else not at all,
so that we are only then moral when we possess it wholly, and the
unwise or non-virtuous man is absolutely vicious‚ there being no
mean betwixt good and evil-such propositions as this are practi-
Μ for such an ideal standard of virtue is wholly
beyond the power of any man to realize, and therefore from the
Stoics' own theory it must follow that all men are unwise and
vicious. Thus the confession of these principles really obliges men
to nothing; for to bind oneself to live in accordance with the
tenets of such a stately and heroic philosophy, i.e. to lay claim to
the name of the really wise, was in effect a monstrous assumption:
the average man must be content to contemplate with admiration
such a representation of the ideal of virtue, getting on as well as
he could with his own vice and that of society at large—ot, if so
inclined, amusing himself with lofty declarations in praise of the
personification of their κατόρθωμα or ‘ideal life of rectitude'‚ as
philosophers by profession loved to do. Even Cicero, who was
not a philosopher by profession, took the trouble to explain in
popular language six favourite paradoxes of the School and
to defend them with popular arguments-though, by his own
confession, he was not in earnest, when he did so: his work was a
mere jeu d’esprit, he says; ego vero illu ipsa, qune τίκ in gym-
nasiis et in otz'o Stoici probant, lu dens corrieci in communes locos³⁷.

While the greatest frivolity might be found coexisting with
Stoicism (and there were not wanting Stoic philosophers who
drew the most repulsive deductione from the principles of their
school), on the other hand some earnest men-who, without
pursuing the fantastic ideal of the Stoic wise man, felt a-vocation
to set the universe to rights philosophically, and to form a
judgrnent on questions which intimately concerned the cultivated
society of the day-would hardly have been attracted by the Stoic
ethical philosophy, had they not made acquaintance with it in
a form which really borrowed its name only from Stoicism.

The leader of this neo-Stoic movement,whichbecame the fashion a

at Rome through his introduction of it there, wasFfflna-etjus g
