scobis philosophia laudata, profecto eius tractatio optimo atque orooplissimo
quoque dignissima est, de fin. 1 ἐ 1 philosophiae quidem vituperatoribus
satis responsum est eo libro, quo o uobis philosophia defenso et collaudata est,
eum esset accusata et vituperata ab Hortensio. Qui libercumet tibi (Brute)
probatus uidereturet iis, quos ego posse iudicare arbitrarer, pluro suscepi.
Τ he work alluded to is lost with t e exception of a t'ew fragments; it was
named aster the celebrated orator Q. Hortensius (111 ἓ 73), to whom it
was dedicated. It appears srom ep. ad Att. >1111 18 that the Hortensius
was written before the Academics were finished, i.e. before July 13.c. 45.
Augustino consess. 1114 praises the work very highly, and says οἱ it: ille
iiber mutauit affectum meum et od te ipsum, Domine, neutauit preces meas et
uoto ac desideria mea fecit alia.

ἓν, 1. 8. occurritur autem nobis] ‘it is objected to me‚' de fin. 11

ᾖ 108 quid occurrat (i.e. adimatur) noes oslietis, Ac. 11 ἕ 44 occurretur
enim, suut occursum est. So Gr. ἀπαντᾶν. Having disposed of the objec-
tion urged by the boui uiri, Cicero now considers the objections of philoso-
phers and scholars (docti et madito), ‘How can you’, say they, ‘an Academic,
pretend to lay down fixed rules of duty, when it is a maximos your sect
that nothing can be known? is not this a contradiction oi your principles?

or will you admit that you don’t know the truth of your own rulesl'
Cicero’s answer is that he is not one ol the Sceptics or Aporetics‚ the
followers of Pyrrho, who held that all things were alike probable, and
nothing could have so much said for it, but that as much might be said
against it, and accordingly doubted about everything. Nor was he one os

, the dogmatics, who held some things to be absolutely certain and some un·
certain, but, adopting a middle opinion, he maintains with the Academics
that some things are highly probable and some improbable; though, there-
fore, he does not positively affirm his rules as certain, yet as thinking them

so extremely probable that no wise man can reiuse assent to them, he is

. fully justified and quite consistentinlaying them down. See Introd.§8.

etquidem] ‘and that too?
1 9. constanter mare] ‘to act consistently.'

Llo. qui oum-dieamus-solcamus] duamur is subjunctive in con-
cessive clause introduced by cum=‘although,' soleamus aster qui causal.

parant num posse] ‘that nothing maybe known for certain:' the
opinion oi the Academics to whose sect Cicero so far belonged. Acad.

inulta posse, ib. 11 ἕ 66 uisa ista cum aeriter nuntem sensumve pepulerunt,
accipio iisque interdum etiam assentior, nec percipio tomen ; nihil enim
arbitror posse percipi. The Greek equivalent oi perceptio is κατάληψις,
cp. Tischer Tusc. 1 ἓ 17 n.

1. 11. mecam] ‘to propound one's own opinion’ intermediate between
iudicare, affirmare, and disceptare ‘to weigh the grounds for and
against, without expressing an opinion,' which was the method ol the
Sceptics: de nat. deor. 111 ἓ 95 ego ueruto, quae disputavi, disserere
malui quom iudicare, ad lam. 111 8, 5 disputabant, ego contro disserebam:
dicebaut, ego negabam.
