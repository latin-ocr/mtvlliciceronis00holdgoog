1t may have been accident but it was more probably immediate
political circumstances that determined Cicero's choice of a subject,
and his method of treating in The present work is his first attempt

at the araenetic side of moral philosophy, and the application
of its princrp es to the regulation of conduct and the intercourse

of social and political life. Under the dictatorship of Caesar,
when he lived in retirement and became resigned to a life of
political inaction, Cicero had confined himself to the speculative
side of Ethics ancl Metaphysics. But in a grave political crisis,
such as followed the death of Caesar, when he was looked up
to as the mainstay of his party against the brutal and undisguised
despotism oi Antonius, it was natural that his thoughts should
be diverted from abstract discussions and questions ‘on the chief
good' and ‘the being of the gods' to those of practical interest
The de officiis is his last farewell to his family and country.

Cicero, as we have seen, resolved to dedicate the work to his
son Marcus. Marcus Tullius Cicero, only son of the orator
and his wile Terentia, was born in ne 65 ³. He had naturally

make a philosopher and orator of him On his return from Cilicia,
whither he had accompanied his father in nc 51, he crossed to

oi Pompeius, from whom he received the command of a squadron
of cavalry, and won the good opinion of his general and the whole
army by his skill in military exercises and manly endurance oi
labour⁴. ln ne. 45 he had a great desire to proceed to Spain
and take part in the service oi Caesar against his former friends.
His father, however, refused to gratisyhis desire and sent him instead
to Athens⁶ to prosecute his studies there along with several other
young Romans of distinguished family⁶. At Athens, although
