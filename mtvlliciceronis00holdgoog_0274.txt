are comprehended under that science, which the Greeks call εὐταξία,
not in its sense of ‘seli-control' modestia, but in that of ‘correct
behaviour‚' propriety of our actions in regard to tirne aud place.
Pliny Epist. 11 5 17 employs the word dispositum to express the same
notion, and similarly in epist. 111 1 speaks of dispositam vitam.

1. 21. ut eandem nos ‘modestiam’ appellemus] ‘to call it also
modestia! Ρ. 8. Gap. 468. Cicero means that there is no Latin word
which will exactly render the Greek εὐταξίας modestia (Gr. μετριότης)
involves properly the notion of ‘moderatiori’ (modus Gr. μέτρον), he
takes a liberty therefore in using it in another sense, as equivalent to the
Greek εὐταξία. According to the Stoics it is the knowledge of ranging
under their proper heads all that we have to say or to do; thus the
meaning os the words order (or regularity) and arrangement (or method)
is seen to be identical: sor both order isdefined by thern to be the disposiug
os things in their proper and suitable places; and the place os an action
is with them its fitness as to time, and the fitting time for an action is
called in Greek εὐκαιρία, in Latin occasio, ‘season,’ so that modestia here
(in the sense os the word which is now given it) is to be understood as the
art os well-timing whatever we do. The Stoics defined εὐταξία (Stob.
ecl.116p. 106) as ἐπιστήμη corindae πρακτέον καί τί μετὰ τί καί καθόλου
τῆς τάξεως τῶν πράξεων. The word is also applied to the harmony oi
the individual soal, as when σωφροσύνη is defined to be εὐαρμοστία καί
εὐταξία ψυχῆς πρὸς τοὶς κατὰ φύσιν ἡδονὰς καί λύπας.
