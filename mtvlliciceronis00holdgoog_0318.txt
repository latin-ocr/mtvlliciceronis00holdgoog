1. 36. alae murt] if the reading be correct this must mean ‘one of the
vtwo alae or divisions of the allies' ‘'lhe infantry of the socii was placed
on the wings of the legions, and hence the normata, alarii and cohortes
alariae are em loyed to designate the whole force of the allies, both horse
and foot, amp the two divisions were distinguished as dextera ala and
sinistro ala. Ala in this sense must be carefully distinguished from als
when it signifies the 300 Roman horse which formed the cavalry of the
legion and which received their name in like manner from having been in
ancient times employed to cover the flantis! Ramsay Rom. Antiq.
p. 385. Heine has the following note: 'the cavalry of the allies (auxili-
ares) was divided into alae, containing from 300 to 400 men. In Cicero’s
day it was usual for young men of the higher class not to enter the legion
alirectly‚ bnt to serve first as contubernales imperatoris, and they received
generally the command of an ala. The custom was continued in the time
, of the Emperors (Plin. Ep. x 19, Sueton. Aug. 38, 46, Claud. 25), and
young Cicero received the distinction in his ryth year. Consequently,
alteri must be expunged, for there were not two alneto a legion, but more
or less according to circumstances Ala altera could only refer to the half
of the army of socii, the Italian allies, who were divided into ala dextera
and sinistra, but the difference between socii and legroues Romanae had
ceased, since the Italians had been enfranchised, Β. c. 89. Alteri was added
by some one unacquainted with the division of the army, and to whom
therefore ala without altera appeared unintelligible-⁹
