Μ. hostia vocantur] Hume, inanote to his Essay on Commerce,
differs in opinion from Cicero. ‘The more antient Romans’ says he ‘lived
in perpetual war with all their neighbours, and, in old Latin, the term
hostes expressed both ‘a stranger‘ and ‘an enemy! This is remarked by
Cicero, but'by him ascribed to the humanity of his ancestors, who sost-
ened as much as possible the denomination osan ene my by calling him by
the same appellatron which signified a stran ger. It is howevermuoh more

, probable, from the manners of the times, that the ferocity of those people

was so great as to make them regard all strangers as enemies‚ and call
them by the same name. Itis not, besides, consistent with the most com-
mon maxims of policy or nature, that any state should regard its public
enemies with a friendly eye, or preserve any such sentiments ior them, as
the Roman orator would ascribe to his ancestors Not to mention that the
early Romans really exercised piracy‚ as we learn from their first treaties
with Carthage preserved by Polybius: and consequently, like the Sallee
and Algerine tovers, were actually at war with most nations, and a stranger
and an enemy were with them almost synonymous.' Donaldson (Varroni-
anus ed. 3, ch. vt 5 8 p. 244) notices that ‘the Latin tastis and the Greek
ξένος, starting from opposite points, have interchanged their significations.
Hostis from citas originally signified a person entertained by another, ‘one
who has iood given to him,’ (comp. tropi-[tbi ‘the protector oi strangers,'
Germ. ‘gast’ but at last it came to mean ‘a stranger' ‘a foreigner5’ and even
‘an enemy.' Whereas ξένος originally denoting a ‘stranger‘ (extraneus)
imp ⁰ng,ti‘¹¹⁰¹¹t (titios), came in the end to signiiy ‘an entertainer’ and
‘ rien .
