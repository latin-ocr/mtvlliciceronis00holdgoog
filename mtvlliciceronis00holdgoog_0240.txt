Ι 171 mitis sapientia Laeli. The person meant is Gaius Laelius the

younger, the distinguished statesman, soldier and man of letters, who
was born about ac. 186, consul uc. ¹40 with Q. Servilius Caepio
(de am. 596), and whose intimate friendship with Scipio Africanus the
younger (de am. 1 54, de rep. 15 18, de off. 15 108, de or. 11522)
is constantly spoken oi by Cicero as an example of what friendship should
be. He distinguished himself against Viriathus in Spain Β. 0. 145 (11 5 40).
buthe was more of a statesman than a soldier and more 01 a philosopher
than a statesman. He imbibed the doctrines of the Stoic school rom
Diogenes Babylonius and Panaetius, and was a friend of Polybius and
Terence, whose plays were by some ascribed to him. As tribune, he en·
deavoured (according to Plutarch Tib. Gracch. c. 8) to procure a redivision
of the public land, but desisted from the attempt, and ior his forbear-
ance was designated Sapiens (11 5 40), 111 5 16, Tusc. 4 5 5, Brut. 5213,
5 84. He afterwards became a staunch supportes ol the optimates. The
treatise de amicitia is called Laelius after him (115 3¹) because he is
the chief interlocutor in the dialogue. He is also one of the speakers in
the de senectute and in the de republica. His grandfather was a con·
temporary of the elder Scipio Africanus, and consul with his brother
Scipio Asiaticus 110. 190.

110. 338, two years before his death, by his victory at Chaeronea reduced
Greece to subjection.
